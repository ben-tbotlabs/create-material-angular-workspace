# `> npx create-material-angular-workspace`

Creates an [Nx Workspace](https://nx.dev/) that includes:

-   [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
-   [Angular Flexbox](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout)
    -   Helpful documentation at [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
-   [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/)

This

{{getting-started}}

```
? Workspace name (e.g., org name)     exampleorg
? Application name
```

If it's your first Nx project, the command will recommend you to install the `nx` package globally, so you can invoke `nx` directly without going through yarn or npm.

## Serving Application

-   Run `nx serve myapp` to serve the newly generated application!
-   Run `nx test myapp` to test it.
-   Run `nx e2e myapp-e2e` to run e2e tests for it.

Angular users can also run `ng g/serve/test/e2e`.
